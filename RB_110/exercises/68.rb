# Reversing and Combining Text
=begin
Your task is to Reverse and Combine Words.
Input: String containing different "words" separated by spaces

1. More than one word? Reverse each word and combine first with second, third 
    with fourth and so on...
  (odd number of words => last one stays alone, but has to be reversed too)
2. Start it again until there's only one word without spaces
3. Return your resultâ€¦
=end

=begin
P
Input: string with words
Output: string with reversed words and no spaces

E
"abc def ghi jkl" --> cbafed ihglkj -> defabcjklghi

D
strings, arrays

A
- TRANSFORM string to array of words
  - if in a string only 1 word, return word without modifying
  - if more than 2, separate by spaces each word
- REVERSE every word
  - iterate over array of words
  - reverse every word
- COMBINE words by pairs -> 1 and 2, 3 and 4 and so on
  - iterate with simple loop and counter
  - concatenate by index
  - add to another array
  - if there are still more than 1 word, repeat reverse and combine
- RETURN the last string
  - convert array with 1 string to string
